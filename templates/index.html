<p>
    In the past two seasons, the Lakers have battled hard, showing flashes of brilliance and grit.
From 2022 to 2024, the *Purple and Gold* posted a solid 90–74 record, with LeBron James and Anthony Davis leading the charge. We made a deep playoff run in 2023, falling to the Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals. The 2024 season saw us finish 7th in the West, with promising performances from Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura. While the championship eluded us, the heart, hustle, and Hollywood flair never faded. Lakers Nation stands proud—because every season is another step toward banner #18!
